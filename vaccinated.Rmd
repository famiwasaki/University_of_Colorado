## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

global_vaccine <- read_csv(url("https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/raw/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/global_data/time_series_covid19_vaccine_global.csv"))

summary(global_vaccine)


global_vaccine %>% filter(Country_Region == "Japan") %>% ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Doses_admin))+geom_point(aes(y=Doses_admin))






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
